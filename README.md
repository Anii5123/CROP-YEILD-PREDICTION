"# CROP-YEILD-PREDICTION" 

step1: 
git clone 

step 2:
create a folder structure-
crop_yield_project/
├─ yield_df.csv                # download from Kaggle and put here
├─ train.py                    # training + model saving (below)
├─ app_streamlit.py            # streamlit UI (below)
├─ requirements.txt            # pip requirements (below)
├─ models/                     # (created by train.py) holds saved pipelines
├─ outputs/
│  └─ metrics.csv              # generated by train.py

step 3: 
create env and activate

step 4: 
pip install -r "requirements.txt"

step 5:
python train.py

step 6:
streamlit run app_streamlit.py


Description:

Farmers want to know how much crop they can expect under certain conditions (rainfall, temperature, pesticides, etc.).
The project uses Machine Learning (ML) to predict yield per hectare based on historical data.

Inputs & Outputs
Inputs (what user enters in Streamlit app):

Year

Rainfall (mm)

Temperature (°C)

Pesticide use (tonnes)

Country (Area)

Crop (Item)

Outputs:

Farmer View:

Yield in Kg/hectare & Quintals/hectare

Traffic-light indicator (Good / Average / Low yield)

Technical View:

Yield in hg/ha (raw prediction)

Model metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²

4. Why Machine Learning Algorithms?

We can’t write a simple formula like Yield = Rainfall * Temp * Pesticides because relationships are non-linear & complex.
That’s why we test different ML models:

a) Linear Regression

Simple, easy to interpret.

Assumes straight-line relationship between inputs & yield.

Good baseline model.

b) Random Forest 🌳

Collection of many decision trees (“forest”).

Works well with non-linear, messy data.

More accurate than Linear Regression but less interpretable.

c) Decision Tree

Easy to explain (“If rainfall > 500 → yield high, else low”).

Not very accurate alone, but useful for interpretability.

d) Gradient Boosting

Builds trees step by step, correcting errors.

Often most accurate (but slower).

👉 That’s why we use all 4 models:

Farmers get robust results (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting)

Experts can compare with simple Linear Regression
