# CROP YIELD PREDICTION

A Machine Learning project to predict crop yields per hectare based on historical data and environmental conditions.

---

## Project Description

Farmers want to know how much crop they can expect under certain conditions (rainfall, temperature, pesticides, etc.).
This project uses Machine Learning (ML) to predict yield per hectare based on historical crop data.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anii5123/CROP-YEILD-PREDICTION.git
cd CROP-YEILD-PREDICTION
```

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Train the models

```bash
python train.py
```

This will generate trained models in `models/` and evaluation metrics in `outputs/metrics.csv`.

### Step 5: Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
```

Open the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to interact with the app.

## Inputs & Outputs

### Inputs (via Streamlit app):

* Year
* Rainfall (mm)
* Temperature (°C)
* Pesticide use (tonnes)
* Country (Area)
* Crop (Item)

### Outputs:

**Farmer View:**

* Yield in Kg/hectare & Quintals/hectare
* Traffic-light indicator (Good / Average / Low yield)

**Technical View:**

* Yield in hg/ha (raw prediction)
* Model metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²

## Why Machine Learning Algorithms?

We cannot write a simple formula like:

```
Yield = Rainfall * Temperature * Pesticides
```

Because relationships between factors and yield are **non-linear and complex**.
Hence, we use different ML models:

### a) Linear Regression

* Simple and easy to interpret
* Assumes straight-line relationship between inputs & yield
* Serves as a baseline model

### b) Random Forest 🌳

* Collection of many decision trees (“forest”)
* Handles non-linear and messy data well
* More accurate than Linear Regression but less interpretable

### c) Decision Tree

* Easy to explain (e.g., “If rainfall > 500 → yield high, else low”)
* Not very accurate alone but useful for interpretability

### d) Gradient Boosting

* Builds trees step by step, correcting errors
* Often the most accurate, but slower

> Using all 4 models ensures:
>
> * Farmers get robust predictions (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting)
> * Experts can compare results with simpler models (Linear Regression)
